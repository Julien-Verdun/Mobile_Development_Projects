The basic movement is performed in four steps and known as a \"four - count burpee \". Begin in a standing position. Move into a squat position with your hands on the ground. Kick your feet back into a plank position, while keeping your arms extended. Immediately return your feet into squat position. Stand up from the squat position."

        "description": "The kettlebell swing (AKA Russian swing, double-arm swing, or conventional kettlebell swing) is a basic ballistic exercise used to train the posterior chain in a manner similar to broad jumping. The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms straight or slightly bent, the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell. The key to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips, not bending too much at the knees and sending the weight forwards, as opposed to squatting the weight up, or lifting up with the arms. Some knee flexion (a squat) is commonly employed during the swing, although there is some controversy[citation needed] as to whether a swing can or should be performed with just a hip hinge instead. This exercise requires an intense contraction of the gluteal, abdominal and latissimus muscles."

        "description": "Throwing a few jumps into your workout builds speed and strength, and is especially useful for people hitting the gym to improve their performance in sports. Plus, jumping as high or as far as you can is also fun and a great way to break any monotony that has crept into your workouts. The box jump is a plyometric move that strengthens your main lower-body muscles – glutes, quads, calves and hamstrings. Box jumps will help make you faster, more powerful and springier than ever, and if you do them for more than a few seconds, they’ll raise your heart rate and burn calories like nobody’s business."

        "exercise": "Squat",
        "description": "A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up. \n Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus. The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others. \n The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise programs."

By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly in military physical training. They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, or some martial arts disciplines."

Many strength and fitness athletes will find that training the dumbbell snatch (either for heavier power/strength training or for more cardiovascular/muscle endurance training) can be beneficial for overall performance. Start with a dumbbell directly below you, so that you are standing over it evenly. Squat down so that you are in a similar start position to a deadlift, with the chest and head up, and shoulders slightly higher than the hips. Lift the dumbbell with the legs and back, coming straight up with the dumbbell, making sure not to bend the arm early. Once you have pulled as high as you can, turn the elbow underneath the dumbbell, ending in the overhead position of the movement. You can receive the dumbbell in the standing overhead position, similar to the muscle snatch, or you can re-bend the knees and hips to receive the dumbbell at a lower point."

The most common plank is the forearm plank which is held in a push-up-like position, with the body's weight borne on forearms, elbows, and toes. Many variations exist such as the side plank and the reverse plank. The plank is commonly practiced in Pilates and yoga, and by those training for boxing and other sports. The \"extended plank \" adds substantial difficulty to the standard plank exercise. To perform the extended plank, a person begins in the push-up position and then extends the arms or hands as far forward as possible"

Lift your hips and knees from the mat while exhaling. Your torso is straight in line with no sagging or bending. Hold the position. \n The side The side plank is a great exercise for strengthening the oblique abdominal muscles, which don't get worked during ab exercises such as crunches. You will hold your body on your side in straight position supported only by one arm and the side of one foot. Strong obliques can be quite useful as core stabilization muscles. Beginners must build the strength and balance needed with warmups for the obliques and modified side planks before progressing to the side plank. You can include side planks in your core exercise routine, Pilates, or yoga practice."

In later decades, this usage has inverted, with some using \"chin - up \" to refer to a pull-up done with a supinated hand position, while \"pull-up \" refers specifically to the exercise done with a pronated hand position. Pull-ups use many different muscles of the upper body, including the latissimus dorsi and the biceps brachii."

Here are the steps to do the jumping lunge exercise properly, safely, and effectively. Before starting, make sure you have a space large enough to perform the move. Also consider moving benches and other equipment out of the way. \nStand with feet shoulder-width apart, with your core engaged. \nTake a big step forward with your right leg. Keep your arms by your side. \nShift your weight forward with this leg, so your heel touches the floor first. Then lower your body until the forward leg is parallel to the floor. This is the bottom position. \nJump up, quickly switching the position of your feet while mid-air so your right leg moves back behind you and your left leg comes forward. To help you move explosively, propel your arms into the air while you jump. \nGently land back on the floor in a basic lunge position with the opposite leg forward. \nRepeat this movement pattern, switching legs on each jump, for the desired amount of time or repetitions. Beginners should aim for 5 to 10 reps on each leg or 30 seconds total. As this gets easier, work your way up to 60 seconds of continuous jumping lunges"
